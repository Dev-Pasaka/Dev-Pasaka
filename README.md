# 👋 Hey, I'm Pasaka!

🚀 I'm a passionate backend and mobile engineer building decentralized finance tools for the real world. I focus on creating inclusive, secure, and high-performance systems — especially for the underbanked and unbanked in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## 🧠 What I'm Working On

- 🔗 **CoinX** – A decentralized banking & finance platform making crypto simple and social
- 🤖 **Android Apps** with **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**
- 🧠 **AI-powered assistants** for account management & transactions
- 📲 **WhatsApp onboarding & interfaces** for fast, familiar access to crypto
- 💳 **Depbits Cards** – Virtual & physical cards for seamless crypto spending
- 🌍 **Decentralized WASM-based runtime** to deploy services directly on the blockchain

## 🛠️ My Tech Stack

**Languages & Runtimes**
- Kotlin (Ktor,Spring Boot, Android Native, Jetpack Compose, KMP)
- Rust (Systems & Blockchain)

**Mobile Development**
- Android Native (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)
- Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) – Shared code across Android, iOS, and more

**Backend & DevOps**
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Redis, MongoDB, Apache Kafka, Temporal
- Nginx, Traefik as API Gateway
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- AWS (EC2, S3, Route 53, Cloudflare)

**Blockchain & Runtime Systems**
- Custom WASM Runtime for service execution
- Proof-of-Work based resource pricing
- Wallet-based micro-billing & auto-scaling
- GPU-aware miner rewards
